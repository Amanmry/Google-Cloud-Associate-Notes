# Section 1: Setting up a cloud solution environment

The Associate Cloud Engineer Exam is one of the possibilities for you to obtain a Cloud Certification.

An Associate Cloud Engineer deploys and secures applications, services, and infrastructure, monitors operations of multiple projects, and maintains enterprise solutions to ensure that they meet target performance metrics.

With 50 questions that must be answered in 2 hours, you must have knowledge in tools like Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Kubernetes Engine and commands like gcloud, gsutil, bq, kubectl.

## 1.1 Setting up cloud projects and accounts

### Identity Access Management (IAM)


- With IAM, we manage access control by defining who (identity) has what access (role) for which resource;

- We don’t grant permissions to users directly. Instead, we identify roles that contain the appropriate permissions, and then grant those roles to the user;

- It is recommended to give access by assigning someone to a group instead of bounding them directly to a role;

- The model for access management has three main parts: 

    - **Principal -** can be a Google Account, a service account, a Google group, or a Google Workspace account or Cloud Identity domain that can access a resource; 

    - **Role -** a collection of permissions;  

    - **Policy -** the allow policy is a collection of role bindings that bind one or more principals to individual roles, for example:

    ```
        {
        "bindings": [
            {
                "role": "roles/storage.objectAdmin",
                "members": [
                    "user:ali@example.com",
                    "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com",
                    "group:admins@example.com",
                    "domain:google.com"
                ]
            },
            {
                "role": "roles/storage.objectViewer",
                "members": [
                    "user:maria@example.com"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

- The value **allUsers** is a special identifier that represents **anyone who is on the internet,** including authenticated and unauthenticated users;

- Some services support granting IAM permissions at a granularity finer than the project level **(we can give permission to a specific bucket or VM instance for example);**

- Permissions determine what operations are allowed on a resource, represented by **service.resource.verb;**

### Roles


- It is not recommended to use Basic Roles because they include thousands of permissions across all Google Cloud services. Instead grant the most limited predefined roles or custom roles and grant basic roles unless there is no alternative;

- The recommended practice when assigning roles is the Principal of Minimal Privilege, in which we grant access only to what they need to do the job;

- Basic roles: Owner, Editor, and Viewer;

- Predefined roles: Roles that give finer-grained access control than the basic roles;

- Custom roles: Roles that we create to tailor permissions to the needs of our organization when predefined roles don’t meet our needs. We create custom role based on roles that already exists, by combining or modifying them;

- A Role is specified in the form of roles/service.roleName;

- There is no Role:Owner at the organization level.

### Hierarchy


- Resource hierarchy: Organization > Folders > Projects > Resources;

- Resources inherit the allow policies of all of their parent resources;

- Google Cloud users are not required to have an organization resource. Folders are also optional;

- Project resource ID: unique identifier for the project resource that can be changed during creation but not after;

- Project resource number: automatically assigned when we create the project. Cannot be changed during creation neither after;

- Project name: defined by us and mutable during and after creation;

## 1.2 Managing billing configuration

- To use Google Cloud resources in a project, even during the free time, billing must be enabled on the project (linked to an active Cloud Billing account);

### Budget

- Budget enables us to track our actual Google Cloud costs against our planned costs;

- Billing account types: 

    - **self-serve (online) accounts —** manage the forms of payment we use to automatically pay for our costs; 

    - **invoiced (offline) accounts —** Cloud Billing account that pays for our usage costs with a monthly invoice (Google must configure invoiced accounts for us);

- After we’ve set a budget amount, we set budget alert threshold rules that are used to trigger email notifications (the receivers must have billing related roles);

### Cloud Monitoring

- Using Cloud Monitoring, you can specify other people in your organization to receive budget alert emails;

### Discounts

- **Free tiers discount:** Some services offer free resource usage up to specified limits;

- **Sustained use discounts:** automatic discounts that we get for running specific Compute Engine resources a significant portion of the billing month;

- **Committed use discounts (resource based):** we can purchase committed use contracts in return for deeply discounted prices for VM usage;

- **Committed use discounts (spend based):** provide a discount in exchange for your commitment to spend a minimum amount for a service in a particular region;

- **Spending based discounts (contractual):** Discounts applied after a contractual spending threshold is reached;

- **Subscriptions:** Long term subscriptions to services that are purchased in exchange for discounts;

## 1.3 Installing and configuring the command line interface (CLI), specifically the Cloud SDK

- To interact with Cloud Storage, we use gsutil;

- CLI Interface: We can install the Google Cloud CLI. The gcloud CLI allows us to open a terminal window on our own computer and run commands to manage Google Cloud resources or we can open Cloud Shell on the Cloud Console;

- Cloud Shell provides a temporary Compute Engine virtual machine instance, built-in code editor, 5 GB of persistent disk storage, pre-installed gcloud CLI and other tools, language support for Java, Go, Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby and .NET, Web preview functionality and Built-in authorization for access to Google Cloud console projects and resources;

- gcloud: Tool for interacting with Google Cloud. Only commands at the General Availability and Preview release levels are installed with this component (use gcloud alpha or beta to use commands at these release levels);

- bq: tool for interacting with BigQuery;

- gsutil: tool for perfoming tasks related to Cloud Storage;

- core: Libraries used internally by the gcloud CLI tools;

- Default configurations are set using the gcloud config command;
